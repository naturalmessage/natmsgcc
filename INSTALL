This is only one part of the installation process for the Natural Message
command line client.

The easiest installation process on tested platforms would be to download
and run the NatMsgInstaller.py, which will also install dependencies.
Download the script from here:

  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naturalmessage/natmsgccInstall/master/NatMsgInstall.py

On Linux, BSD, etc, run:
	sudo python3 NatMsgInstall.py

On Windows, if you have Python 3 in your search path, run
	python NatMsgInstall.py

If you want to see the full installer package you can download the tar.gz file or the .zip file:

  wget https://github.com/naturalmessage/natmsgccInstall/archive/master.tar.gz

  wget https://github.com/naturalmessage/natmsgccInstall/archive/master.zip

The Python 3 programs in this project require other things that are not 
installed here... If the NatMsgInstaller.py program does not work on your
system, you can install these (check the NatMsgInstaller.py program for the
latest version of each, especially on Windows):

 * pycrypto: https://www.dropbox.com/s/n6rckn0k6u4nqke/pycrypto-2.6.1.zip?dl=1
 * requests: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/tarball/master
 * RNCryptor: https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-python/tarball/master
	 (RNCryptor pure python module is included in this package, so you do not
   need to download it).
 * Natural Message Server Verification programs (C programs that are needed if 
   you want to verify the identity of servers).

For this to run, you need to have python 3 (not version 2.x).  If you are
using Windows, you need to use the exact python version that corresponds to
one of the packages built for Windows.  That is because the pycrypto library
has to be compiled for the exact Windows configuration.

For this to run, you might want to install setuputils from your package
manager. Many systems already have setuputils, but some do not.  For FreeBSD,
try the following (use the appropriate version for your system and version of
python):

  $ pkg search setuputils
  $ pkg install py34-setuptools34-5.5.1

natmsgcc uses distutils.  Use setup.py to install it in the usual way:

  $ python setup.py install

You can, of course, do

  $ python setup.py --help
